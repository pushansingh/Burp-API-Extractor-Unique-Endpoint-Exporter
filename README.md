📦 Burp API Extractor – Unique Endpoint Exporter
Burp API Extractor is a Burp Suite extension that helps export unique API endpoints from either Proxy History or Repeater. It supports domain filtering, HTTP method inclusion, path normalization, and the choice between full URLs or just endpoint paths. Results are exported to a CSV file.

🔹 Features
✅ Extracts endpoints from Proxy History or Repeater
✅ Filters by domain (optional)
✅ Option to include HTTP methods
✅ Option to export full URL or trimmed endpoint path
✅ Supports dynamic path normalization (e.g. /api/user/123 → /api/user/{num})
✅ Removes duplicate endpoints
✅ Works with both HTTP and HTTPS

🛠️ How It Works
Listens to HTTP requests in Proxy and Repeater tabs.

Extracts clean API endpoints (removes query parameters).

Prompts user to choose:

Source (Proxy or Repeater)

Filter domain (optional)

Include method? (GET/POST etc.)

Full URL or trimmed path?

Normalize dynamic paths?

Saves to burp_unique_api_endpoints.csv.
